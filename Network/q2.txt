when recieving a packet we check its raw data and make sure the packet refers to the course website. (similarly to the previous question)

Our job is to return a response that cuases the redirection to instagram.
We do this with returning a packet where we swap the destination and source addresses in the IP and TCP protocols, and the returning an ack of the same seq and update the sequence.

we then send a packet back which contains RESPONSE as raw data and causing the redirection.

*the redirection does not occur always and there as a race between the original respnse and ours.
