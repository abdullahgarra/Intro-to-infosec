after playing with spacy, we notice that the username and password appear in the raw section of the packet.

we load the raw section into load after decoding it. we then use urlparse and extract the path in the url from it. using regular expressions we alswo extract the host.

we dont want to throw an exception so we use a try except block.
we then parse the data again with parse_qs which makes it easier to extract the username and the password after validating that the website and the host are alike.

we print the username and password found.
