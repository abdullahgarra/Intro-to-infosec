The main vulnerability of run.py is that it runs too long and the file can change while its still rehashing.

From q5.py we run both python script simultaniously. q5_1.py and run.py.

procedure:
	in q5.py we define the main as usual.
	inside the Hack function we open a json
	file (input.json)and insert the Legit
	payload given in the example.

	we then create 2 processes:
	we run run.py and q5_1 simultaneously.
	run.py takes the legit input and starts
	working on it, hence starts rehashing.
	
	meanwhile q5_1 will take the legit
	input, change it, wait for a sec!!
	and then update the json file.
	The validation function does not see
	this update. On the other hand the execution
	function sees this change but it's too late
	and Bob and Alice are hacked.
