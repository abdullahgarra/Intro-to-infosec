we see that we can use a buffer overflow in order to overwrite the return address of the function and hence cause the program to crash after the return instruction in check password.

we see also in ida that the last byte of the char written sets in EBP-3F which means it takes 3F bytes in hex to get to ebp. add another 4 + 1 to overwrite "ra" since it sets above ebp on the stack. we geet 3f+4+ 1 (hex) = 68 (decimal).
we write 64 bytes of code containnig "a"'s and finish it with 4 "b"'s to recognize where does the ra saved .
