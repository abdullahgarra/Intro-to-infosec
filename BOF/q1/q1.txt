Notincing a really small bug in the source code of sudo where the if condition checks the length of the password entered directly indicates the way we're gonna hack this.

The main function checks if the length is larger than ten (looking at "check_password" function the number should be 9).
since the buff has already 11 bytes written, concatinating a 10 byte string will vause a buffer overflow.
The auth variable is defined right before buff and so it sits above it on the stack. hence, writing 10 bytes where the last byte is 1 will be enough to set auth to 1 and gain access.

we pass [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1] as password and overwrite auth to become 1.
