The login procedure calls "validate_login" on the cookie at some point and checks and acts according to the return value.
Digging depper into "validate_login" function we notice that the function takes the cookie and performs:
 base64.b64decode(cookie).decode()
 and then checks if the result refers to a legit user name in the DB.
 if we insert an encoding of "edward" as a cookie we can hack the system!

thus we run:
document.cookie = "login=ZWR3YXJk;" which allows direct modification to the cookies associated with the current document.
which is the encoding of "edward" ("edward".encode())
