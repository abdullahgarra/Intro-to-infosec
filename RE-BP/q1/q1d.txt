we need to change the line in the assembly code where we check the condition and jump to the relevant section accordingly. (in order to print valid/invalid).

we see a jnz instruction in this line, and hence changing it to jmp will jmp to the "valid" section regardless of the condition's status.

with the help of ida we can identify which byte contains thei nstruction and change it by entering the opcode of 'jmp' (235).
